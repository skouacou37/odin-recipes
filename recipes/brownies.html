        <p><h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Butter</li>
                <li>Eggs</li>
                <li>Sugar "use a mix of granulated sugar and brown sugar"</li>
                <li>Flour "Use all-purpose flour"</li>
                <li>Cocoa Powder "This (obviously) brings the chocolate to the brownies"</li>
                <li>Vanilla extract</li>
                <li>salt</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p><h3>Instructions</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Make the Brownie Batter. Melt the butter in a large bowl, then whisk the eggs and vanilla extract into the melted butter. Continue whisking, or mix with a hand mixer, for 2 minutes – this will create the crinkly top on our brownies. Fold in the dry ingredients, and any mix-ins you may want to use (see variations below) with a rubber spatula or wooden spoon.</li>
                <li>Bake the Brownies. Spread the batter in a parchment paper lined 9×9 pan. Bake as directed in the recipe card below for best results.</li>
            </ol>

            <h4>Expert Success Tips:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Don’t over bake – Follow the bake time and directions given in the recipe card below for best results. It’s better to have slightly under baked brownies with nice fudgy middles, than over baked ones. </li>
                <li>Baking pan – Glass is a poor conductor of heat – almost every baker will tell you this. Use a ceramic or metal pan here rather than a glass one.</li>
            </ul>
